# timeapp

A Flutter app project for displaying the time of places.

## Getting Started

This project is my second flutter app project deployed on Android.

- I used a loader package called flutter_spinkit
- I also used an API to get the time of a location which is from 'worldtimeapi.org'
- Also used the flutter http package for web requests 
- Futhermore, i used the flutter Intl package for better time formatting from the api

## Down
Hopefully, this project would be the beginning of bigger opportunities as I deep down into the world of mobile app development
